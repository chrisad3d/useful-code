This is some useful code:

1. Debugging
   

   From the Command Line: It is the easiest way of using a debugger. You just have to run the following command in terminal.

   This statement loads your source code and stops execution on the first line of code.

       python -m pdb (add your filepath and file name here)

   This is the syntax for VLOOKUP is.

         =VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_number,[range_lookup])

   * lookup_value: This specifies the value that you want to look up in our data.
   * table_array: This is the location where the values are present in excel.
   * col_index_number: This specifies the column number from where we need to return the value.
   * range_lookup: This has two options;
      * if the value is set to FALSE, that means we are looking for an exact match.
      * If the value is TRUE, then we are looking for an approximate match.
